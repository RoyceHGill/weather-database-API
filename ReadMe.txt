Dear Shaun,

In this read me I will have a copy of the connection string to atlas you will
be able to connect to it will be open to connection from any IP over the holidays. It is in the 
Project but this is just in case the worse happens. 

Also if you need to test it localy for any reason I will provide a copy of a working
User that you can copy and paste into the database. Since you need at least one admin user 
to authorise new users.
